In the current world, video gaming has become as popular as TV's in the 70's and 80's. 
Almost everyone now has some gaming console or another.
One of the main features of every conole out on the market is that they have to
have some type of internet connectivity to fully function.
Even though every system is different, they all keep track of about the same information.

User Names
Achievements
A Rank type system
What a User is currently playing.

Some even take notes on how long you play a particular game.

Thus my project will be to see if I can connect to all these differnet consoles and pull my own data out.
I want to make an HTML5 supported web site that pulls out my gaming information from each console and displays it.

The Information I want to pull is:
What if anything, I am currently playing
How long I have been playing it

With this data, I would like to create a graphical per week representation of my gaming so I can keep track of exactly how long
I play a certain title/all together.

Ideas for completion:
    User Interactivy --> Comment or chat box.
    Non-streamed videos of gametime/play :: reviews

Need to find:
    PSN API
    Wii U/Nintendo Network API
    Steam Community API
    **Since hanhelds also have wi-fi capabilities, can we get data off them?**

Section to add in games from older generations.
